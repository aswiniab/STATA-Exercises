Data description:
The given data contains 5 variables- ‘Date’,  ‘Platinum’, ‘Silver’, ‘Palladium’ and ‘Gold’. 
The ‘Date’ variable is of integer data type with day as the unit of measurement. The dates from 8/15/2015 to 8/15/2019. 
The four variables represents daily price of the respective commodities during the time period mentioned. These four variables are of double data type. 

Data processing:
The variable Gold is plotted on a time series Line graph. A new variable DR_Gold is created to show the daily returns of Gold commodity. 

<DR_Gold= 100* (Gold-L.Gold)/L.Gold>

DR_Gold is of float type. A histogram of DR_Gold is generated. A summary statistics of DR_Gold is generated. 

Conclusion:
The skewness is found to be 0.314. That shows the series has a positive skew. It has a slightly longer upper tail than lower tail. 
The coefficient of excess kurtosis (coefficient of kurtosis – 3) of DR_Gold is found to be  1.193. As the coefficient of excess kurtosis is greater than zero, 
the distribution is leptokurtic, ie, is more peaked at the mean than a normally distributed random variable with the same mean and variance, and has fatter tails.
